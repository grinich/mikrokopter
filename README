Run something like 

python terminal.py --baudrate 57600 /dev/tty.usbserial-A40077XV /dev/tty.usbserial-A40078Pl

With the two FTDI serial connections to listen to MKTools.

Serialtest is a bit outdated, but has some stuff that can be used to request messages from the device.

For most of the data, you want to send the 'o' command, or open the OST window in MKTools (connected through the third FTDI serial port)
